Simple command line interface for the Funcube Dongle Pro and Pro+.

This fork by Phlash supports both FCD V1.0, FCD V1.1 and FCD V2.0
in a single program, rather than require specific compilation for
the FCD V2.0

Requires libusb-1.0-dev.


This is a simple command line utility to set the frequency and gain of
Funcube Dongle Pro (V1.0 V1.1) and Pro+ (V2.0) devices.
